Moreover, 11,725 dwellings were flagged by claimants as not habitable, of which 4,499 were categorized as rebuilds. A rebuild designation is not purely based on structural damage and/or habitability, and could have been designated due to uneconomic repairs and/or due to being in a designated red zone (e.g., due to liquefaction).
