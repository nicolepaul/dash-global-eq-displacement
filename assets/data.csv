Household survey results have shown that damage to the building was the top driver of evacuation decisions after New Zealand earthquakes, with nearly 61% of households moving to a friend or family’s house, 4% to a bach or second house, 4% to paid accommodation (e.g., hotel, rental), and 30% seeking other arrangements [(Scheele et al 2019)](https://doi.org/10.21420/TAT3-0313).

Housing damage estimates were provided courtesy the Natural Hazards Commission, formerly the Earthquake Commission (EQC), which insured roughly 90% of all properties in Canterbury: 158,899 dwellings damaged (but not requiring rebuild) and 12,005 dwellings to be rebuilt (assumed as “destroyed”). Moreover, 11,725 dwellings were flagged by claimants as not habitable, of which 4,499 were categorized as rebuilds. A rebuild designation is not purely based on structural damage and/or habitability, and could have been designated due to uneconomic repairs and/or due to being in a designated red zone (e.g., due to liquefaction).
